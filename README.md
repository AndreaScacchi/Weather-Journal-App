# Weather Journal App

I created this app to provide weather's information about the selected city. 
However, I improved the **Weather Journal App** with more features, showing not only the temperature and date, but also the name of the city, the name of the country and a description of the weather.

To complete these features I used an API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/), working with *async* *await* functions.

To build the app, I relied on many technologies, like: 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- Cors
- JSON
- NPM

Moreover, to create the title animation I used the code provide by [Moving Letters](https://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/).

To start the app run `npm start`.
